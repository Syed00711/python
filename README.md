Round half to even (also called banker's rounding) is a rounding rule Python uses when a number is exactly halfway between two possible rounded values
round(2.35, 1)   # 2.4
round(2.25, 1)   # 2.2
round(1.5)   # 2
round(2.5)   # 2
round(3.5)   # 4
round(4.5)   # 4
round(5.5)   # 6

Bitwise operators in Python

Bitwise operators work on the binary representation of integers.

Operator	 Symbol	 Description	Example
AND	         &	         Sets a bit to 1 only if both bits are 1	5 & 3 → 1
OR	         |	         Sets a bit to 1 if either bit is 1	5 | 3 → 7
XOR	         ^	         Sets a bit to 1 if the bits are different	5 ^ 3 → 6
NOT	         ~	         Inverts all bits	~5 → -6
Left Shift	 <<	         Shifts bits left by specified positions	5 << 1 → 10
Right Shift	 >>	         Shifts bits right by specified positions	5 >> 1 → 2

Python operator precedence (highest to lowest)
Precedence	         Operators	           Description
1(Highest)	             ()	                  Parentheses
2	                       **	                  Exponentiation
3	                     +x, -x, ~x	            Unary plus, minus, bitwise NOT
4	                     *, /, //, %	          Multiplication, division, floor division, modulus
5	                        +, -	              Addition, subtraction
6	                       <<, >>	              Bitwise shifts
7	                         &	                Bitwise AND
8	                         ^	                Bitwise XOR
9	                        `	`
10	                ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=,      is, is not, in, not in	Comparisons
11	                       not	               Logical NOT
12	                       and	               Logical AND
13	                       or	                 Logical OR
14 (Lowest)	          =, +=, -=, etc.	          Assignment


Modulus with negative numbers
Python's modulus result has the same sign as the divisor:

a % b = a - b * (a // b)

Here’s a complete list of Python’s keywords:

False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield


A module is a collection of variables and functions. The math module provides a variable called pi that contains the value of the mathematical constant denoted . We can display its value like this:

math.pi

int(string, base)

int(101,2)
5

any number of arguments print
print('Any', 'number', 'of', 'arguments')
